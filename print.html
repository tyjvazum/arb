<p>This handbook is a guide to ordinal theory. Ordinal theory concerns itself with
satoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked,
transferred, and imbued with meaning.</p>
<p>Satoshis, not bitcoin, are the atomic, native currency of the Bitcoin network.
One bitcoin can be sub-divided into 100,000,000 satoshis, but no further.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory does not require a sidechain or token aside from Bitcoin, and
can be used without any changes to the Bitcoin network. It works right now.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory imbues satoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to be
collected and traded as curios.</p>
<p>Individual satoshis can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating unique
Bitcoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in Bitcoin wallets and
transferred using Bitcoin transactions. Inscriptions are as durable, immutable,
secure, and decentralized as Bitcoin itself.</p>
<p>Other, more unusual use-cases are possible: off-chain colored-coins, public key
infrastructure with key rotation, a decentralized replacement for the DNS. For
now though, such use-cases are speculative, and exist only in the minds of
fringe ordinal theorists.</p>
<p>For more details on ordinal theory, see the <a href="overview.html">overview</a>.</p>
<p>For more details on inscriptions, see <a href="inscriptions.html">inscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>When you're ready to get your hands dirty, a good place to start is with
<a href="guides/inscriptions.html">inscriptions</a>, a curious species of digital artifact
enabled by ordinal theory.</p>

<p>Ordinals are a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and
transferring individual sats. These numbers are called <a href="https://ordinals.com">ordinal
numbers</a>. Satoshis are numbered in the order in which
they're mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs
first-in-first-out. Both the numbering scheme and the transfer scheme rely on
<em>order</em>, the numbering scheme on the <em>order</em> in which satoshis are mined, and
the transfer scheme on the <em>order</em> of transaction inputs and outputs. Thus the
name, <em>ordinals</em>.</p>
<p>Technical details are available in <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/blob/master/bip.mediawiki">the
BIP</a>.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory does not require a separate token, another blockchain, or any
changes to Bitcoin. It works right now.</p>
<p>Ordinal numbers have a few different representations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Integer notation</em>:
<a href="https://ordinals.com/sat/2099994106992659"><code>2099994106992659</code></a> The
ordinal number, assigned according to the order in which the satoshi was
mined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Decimal notation</em>:
<a href="https://ordinals.com/sat/3891094.16797"><code>3891094.16797</code></a> The first
number is the block height in which the satoshi was mined, the second the
offset of the satoshi within the block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Degree notation</em>:
<a href="https://ordinals.com/sat/3%C2%B0111094%E2%80%B2214%E2%80%B316797%E2%80%B4"><code>3°111094′214″16797‴</code></a>.
We'll get to that in a moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Percentile notation</em>:
<a href="https://ordinals.com/sat/99.99971949060254%25"><code>99.99971949060254%</code></a> .
The satoshi's position in Bitcoin's supply, expressed as a percentage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Name</em>: <a href="https://ordinals.com/sat/satoshi"><code>satoshi</code></a>. An encoding of the
ordinal number using the characters <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrary assets, such as NFTs, security tokens, accounts, or stablecoins can
be attached to satoshis using ordinal numbers as stable identifiers.</p>
<p>Ordinals is an open-source project, developed on
GitHub. The project consists of a BIP describing
the ordinal scheme, an index that communicates with a Bitcoin Core node to
track the location of all satoshis, a wallet that allows making ordinal-aware
transactions, a block explorer for interactive exploration of the blockchain,
functionality for inscribing satoshis with digital artifacts, and this manual.</p>
<h2 id="rarity"><a class="header" href="#rarity">Rarity</a></h2>
<p>Humans are collectors, and since satoshis can now be tracked and transferred,
people will naturally want to collect them. Ordinal theorists can decide for
themselves which sats are rare and desirable, but there are some hints…</p>
<p>Bitcoin has periodic events, some frequent, some more uncommon, and these
naturally lend themselves to a system of rarity. These periodic events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Blocks</em>: A new block is mined approximately every 10 minutes, from now until
the end of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Difficulty adjustments</em>: Every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two
weeks, the Bitcoin network responds to changes in hashrate by adjusting the
difficulty target which blocks must meet in order to be accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Halvings</em>: Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the amount of
new sats created in every block is cut in half.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cycles</em>: Every six halvings, something magical happens: the halving and the
difficulty adjustment coincide. This is called a conjunction, and the time
period between conjunctions a cycle. A conjunction occurs roughly every 24
years. The first conjunction should happen some time in 2032.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us the following rarity levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>common</code>: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block</li>
<li><code>uncommon</code>: The first sat of each block</li>
<li><code>rare</code>: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period</li>
<li><code>epic</code>: The first sat of each halving epoch</li>
<li><code>legendary</code>: The first sat of each cycle</li>
<li><code>mythic</code>: The first sat of the genesis block</li>
</ul>
<p>Which brings us to degree notation, which unambiguously represents an ordinal
number in a way that makes the rarity of a satoshi easy to see at a glance:</p>
<pre><code>A°B′C″D‴
│ │ │ ╰─ Index of sat in the block
│ │ ╰─── Index of block in difficulty adjustment period
│ ╰───── Index of block in halving epoch
╰─────── Cycle, numbered starting from 0
</code></pre>
<p>Ordinal theorists often use the terms &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;third&quot;
for <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and <em>D</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>Now for some examples. This satoshi is common:</p>
<pre><code>1°1′1″1‴
│ │ │ ╰─ Not first sat in block
│ │ ╰─── Not first block in difficutly adjustment period
│ ╰───── Not first block in halving epoch
╰─────── Second cycle
</code></pre>
<p>This satoshi is uncommon:</p>
<pre><code>1°1′1″0‴
│ │ │ ╰─ First sat in block
│ │ ╰─── Not first block in difficutly adjustment period
│ ╰───── Not first block in halving epoch
╰─────── Second cycle
</code></pre>
<p>This satoshi is rare:</p>
<pre><code>1°1′0″0‴
│ │ │ ╰─ First sat in block
│ │ ╰─── First block in difficulty adjustment period
│ ╰───── Not the first block in halving epoch
╰─────── Second cycle
</code></pre>
<p>This satoshi is epic:</p>
<pre><code>1°0′1″0‴
│ │ │ ╰─ First sat in block
│ │ ╰─── Not first block in difficulty adjustment period
│ ╰───── First block in halving epoch
╰─────── Second cycle
</code></pre>
<p>This satoshi is legendary:</p>
<pre><code>1°0′0″0‴
│ │ │ ╰─ First sat in block
│ │ ╰─── First block in difficulty adjustment period
│ ╰───── First block in halving epoch
╰─────── Second cycle
</code></pre>
<p>And this satoshi is mythic:</p>
<pre><code>0°0′0″0‴
│ │ │ ╰─ First sat in block
│ │ ╰─── First block in difficulty adjustment period
│ ╰───── First block in halving epoch
╰─────── First cycle
</code></pre>
<p>If the block offset is zero, it may be omitted. This is the uncommon satoshi
from above:</p>
<pre><code>1°1′1″
│ │ ╰─ Not first block in difficutly adjustment period
│ ╰─── Not first block in halving epoch
╰───── Second cycle
</code></pre>

<li><code>legendary</code>: 0</li>

</ul>
<p>At the moment, even uncommon satoshis are quite rare. As of this writing,
745,855 uncommon satoshis have been mined - one per 25.6 bitcoin in
circulation.</p>
<h2 id="names"><a class="header" href="#names">Names</a></h2>
<p>Each satoshi has a name, consisting of the letters <em>A</em> through <em>Z</em>, that get
shorter the further into the future the satoshi was mined. They could start
short and get longer, but then all the good, short names would be trapped in
the unspendable genesis block.</p>
<p>As an example, 1905530482684727°'s name is &quot;iaiufjszmoba&quot;. The name of the last
satoshi to be mined is &quot;a&quot;. Every combination of 10 characters or less is out
there, or will be out there, some day.</p>
<h2 id="exotics"><a class="header" href="#exotics">Exotics</a></h2>
<p>Satoshis may be prized for reasons other than their name or rarity. This might
be due to a quality of the number itself, like having an integer square or cube
root. Or it might be due to a connection to a historical event, such as
satoshis from block 477,120, the block in which SegWit activated, or
2099999997689999°, the last satoshi that will ever be mined.</p>
<p>Such satoshis are termed &quot;exotic&quot;. Which satoshis are exotic and what makes
them so is subjective. Ordinal theorists are encouraged to seek out exotics
based on criteria of their own devising.</p>
<h2 id="inscriptions"><a class="header" href="#inscriptions">Inscriptions</a></h2>
<p>Satoshis can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating Bitcoin-native
digital artifacts. Inscribing is done by sending the satoshi to be inscribed in
a transaction that reveals the inscription content on-chain. This content is
then inextricably linked to that satoshi, turning it into an immutable digital
artifact that can be tracked, transferred, hoarded, bought, sold, lost, and
rediscovered.</p>

NFTs has sprung up. <a href="https://mirror.xyz/chainleft.eth/MzPWRsesC9mQflxlLo-N29oF4iwCgX3lacrvaG9Kjko">Here's a great summary of historical NFTs by
Chainleft.</a></p>
<p>A commonly accepted cut-off for early NFTs is March 19th, 2018, the date the
first ERC-721 contract, <a href="https://tenthousandsu.com/">SU SQUARES</a>, was deployed
on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Whether or not ordinals are of interest to NFT archaeologists is an open
question! In one sense, ordinals were created in early 2022, when the Ordinals
specification was finalized. In this sense, they are not of historical
interest.</p>
<p>In another sense though, ordinals were in fact created by Satoshi Nakamoto in
2009 when he mined the Bitcoin genesis block. In this sense, ordinals, and
especially early ordinals, are certainly of historical interest.</p>
<p>Many ordinal theorists favor the latter view. This is not least because the
ordinals were independently discovered on at least two separate occasions, long
before the era of modern NFTs began.</p>
<p>On August 21st, 2012, Charlie Lee <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102355.0">posted a proposal to add proof-of-stake to
Bitcoin to the Bitocin Talk
forum</a>. This wasn't an asset
scheme, but did use the ordinal algorithm, and was implemented but never
deployed.</p>
<p>On October 8th, 2012, jl2012 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117224.0">posted a scheme to the same
forum</a> which uses decimal
notation and has all the important properties of ordinals. The scheme was
discussed but never implemented.</p>
<p>These independent inventions of ordinals indicate in some way that ordinals
were discovered, or rediscovered, and not invented. The ordinals are an
inevitability of the mathematics of Bitcoin, stemming not from their modern
documentation, but from their ancient genesis. They are the culmination of a
sequence of events set in motion with the mining of the first block, so many
years ago.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="digital-artifacts"><a class="header" href="#digital-artifacts">Digital Artifacts</a></h1>
<p>Imagine a physical artifact. A rare coin, say, held safe for untold years in
the dark, secret clutch of a Viking hoard, now dug from the earth by your
grasping hands. It…</p>
<p>…has an owner. You. As long as you keep it safe, nobody can take it from you.</p>
<p>…is complete. It has no missing parts.</p>
<p>…can only be changed by you. If you were a trader, and you made your way to
18th century China, none but you could stamp it with your chop-mark.</p>
<p>…can only be disposed of by you. The sale, trade, or gift is yours to make,
to whomever you wish.</p>
<p>What are digital artifacts? Simply put, they are the digital equivalent of
physical artifacts.</p>
<p>For a digital thing to be a digital artifact, it must be like that coin of
yours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digital artifacts can have owners. A number is not a digital artifact,
because nobody can own it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital artifacts are complete. An NFT that points to off-chain content
on IPFS or Arweave is incomplete, and thus is not a digital artifact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital artifacts are permissionless. An NFT which cannot be sold without
paying a royalty is not permissionless, and thus not a digital artifact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital artifacts are uncensorable. Perhaps you can change a database entry
on a centralized ledger today, but maybe not tomorrow, and thus one cannot be
a digital artifact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital artifacts are immutable. An NFT with an upgrade key is not a digital
artifact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of a digital artifact is intended to reflect what NFTs <em>should</em>
be, sometimes are, and what inscriptions <em>always</em> are, by their very nature.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inscriptions-1"><a class="header" href="#inscriptions-1">Inscriptions</a></h1>
<p>Inscriptions inscribe sats with arbitrary content, creating bitcoin-native
digital artifacts, more commonly known as NFTs. Inscriptions do not require a
sidechain or separate token.</p>
<p>These inscribed sats can then be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent
to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. These transactions, addresses,
and UTXOs are normal bitcoin transactions, addresses, and UTXOS in all
respects, with the exception that in order to send individual sats,
transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according
to ordinal theory.</p>
<p>The inscription content model is that of the web. An inscription consists of a
content type, also known as a MIME type, and the content itself, which is a
byte string. This allows inscription content to be returned from a web server,
and for creating HTML inscriptions that use and remix the content of other
inscriptions.</p>
<p>Inscription content is entirely on-chain, stored in taproot script-path spend
scripts. Taproot scripts have very few restrictions on their content, and
additionally receive the witness discount, making inscription content storage
relatively economical.</p>
<p>Since taproot script spends can only be made from existing taproot outputs,
inscriptions are made using a two-phase commit/reveal procedure. First, in the
commit transaction, a taproot output committing to a script containing the
inscription content is created. Second, in the reveal transaction, the output
created by the commit transaction is spent, revealing the inscription content
on-chain.</p>
<p>Inscription content is serialized using data pushes within unexecuted
conditionals, called &quot;envelopes&quot;. Envelopes consist of an <code>OP_FALSE OP_IF … OP_ENDIF</code> wrapping any number of data pushes. Because envelopes are effectively
no-ops, they do not change the semantics of the script in which they are
included, and can be combined with any other locking script.</p>
<p>A text inscription containing the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; is serialized as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  OP_PUSH &quot;ord&quot;
  OP_1
  OP_PUSH &quot;text/plain;charset=utf-8&quot;
  OP_0
  OP_PUSH &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
OP_ENDIF
</code></pre>
<p>First the string <code>ord</code> is pushed, to disambiguate inscriptions from other uses
of envelopes.</p>
<p><code>OP_1</code> indicates that the next push contains the content type, and <code>OP_0</code>
indicates that subsequent data pushes contain the content itself. Multiple data
pushes must be used for large inscriptions, as one of taproot's few
restrictions is that individual data pushes may not be larger than 520 bytes.</p>
<p>The inscription content is contained within the input of a reveal transaction,
and the inscription is made on the first sat of its first output. This sat can
then be tracked using the familiar rules of ordinal theory, allowing it to be
transferred, bought, sold, lost to fees, and recovered.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ordinal-theory"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ordinal-theory">What is ordinal theory?</a></h2>
<p>Ordinal theory is is a protocol for assigning serial numbers to satoshis, the
smallest subdivision of a bitcoin, and tracking those satoshis as they are
spent by transactions.</p>
<p>These serial numbers are large numbers, like this 804766073970493. Every
satoshi, which is ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀₀ of a bitcoin, has an ordinal number.</p>
<h2 id="does-ordinal-theory-require-a-side-chain-a-separate-token-or-changes-to-bitcoin"><a class="header" href="#does-ordinal-theory-require-a-side-chain-a-separate-token-or-changes-to-bitcoin">Does ordinal theory require a side chain, a separate token, or changes to Bitcoin?</a></h2>
<p>Nope! Ordinal theory works right now, without a side chain, and the only token
needed is bitcoin itself.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ordinal-theory-good-for"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ordinal-theory-good-for">What is ordinal theory good for?</a></h2>
<p>Collecting, trading, and scheming. Ordinal theory assigns identities to
individual satoshis, allowing them to be individually tracked and traded, as
curios and for numismatic value.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory also enables inscriptions, a protocol for attaching arbitrary
content to individual satoshis, turning them into bitcoin-native digital
artifacts.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-ordinal-theory-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-ordinal-theory-work">How does ordinal theory work?</a></h2>
<p>Ordinal numbers are assigned to satoshis in the order in which they are mined.
The first satoshi in the first block has ordinal number 0, the second has
ordinal number 1, and the last satoshi of the first block has ordinal number
4,999,999,999.</p>
<p>Satoshis live in outputs, but transactions destroy outputs and create new ones,
so ordinal theory uses an algorithm to determine how satoshis hop from the
inputs of a transaction to its outputs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that algorithm is very simple.</p>
<p>Satoshis transfer in first-in-first-out order. Think of the inputs to a
transaction as being a list of satoshis, and the outputs as a list of slots,
waiting to receive a satoshi. To assign input satoshis to slots, go through
each satoshi in the inputs in order, and assign each to the first available
slot in the outputs.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a transaction with three inputs and two outputs. The inputs are
on the left of the arrow and the outputs are on the right, all labeled with
their values:</p>
<pre><code>[2] [1] [3] → [4] [2]
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's label the same transaction with the ordinal numbers of the satoshis
that each input contains, and question marks for each output slot. Ordinal
numbers are large, so let's use letters to represent them:</p>
<pre><code>[a b] [c] [d e f] → [? ? ? ?] [? ?]
</code></pre>
<p>To figure out which satoshi goes to which output, go through the input satoshis
in order and assign each to a question mark:</p>
<pre><code>[a b] [c] [d e f] → [a b c d] [e f]
</code></pre>
<p>What about fees, you might ask? Good question! Let's imagine the same
transaction, this time with a two satoshi fee. Transactions with fees send more
satoshis in the inputs than are received by the outputs, so to make our
transaction into one that pays fees, we'll remove the second output:</p>
<pre><code>[2] [1] [3] → [4]
</code></pre>
<p>The satoshis <var>e</var> and <var>f</var> now have nowhere to go in the
outputs:</p>
<pre><code>[a b] [c] [d e f] → [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<p>So they go to the miner who mined the block as fees. <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/blob/master/bip.mediawiki">The
BIP</a> has the details,
but in short, fees paid by transactions are treated as extra inputs to the
coinbase transaction, and are ordered how their corresponding transactions are
ordered in the block. The coinbase transaction of the block might look like
this:</p>
<pre><code>[SUBSIDY] [e f] → [SUBSIDY e f]
</code></pre>

<p>An inscription is an NFT, but the term &quot;digital artifact&quot; is used instead,
because it's simple, suggestive, and familiar.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;digital artifact&quot; is highly suggestive, even to someone who has
never heard the term before. In comparison, NFT is an acronym, and doesn't
provide any indication of what it means if you haven't heard the term before.</p>
<p>Additionally, &quot;NFT&quot; feels like financial terminology, and the both word
&quot;fungible&quot; and sense of the word &quot;token&quot; as used in &quot;NFT&quot; is uncommon outside
of financial contexts.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-nfts"><a class="header" href="#ethereum-nfts">Ethereum NFTs?</a></h3>
<p><em>Inscriptions are always immutable.</em></p>
<p>There is simply no way to for the creator of an inscription, or the owner of an
inscription, to modify it after it has been created.</p>
<p>Ethereum NFTs <em>can</em> be immutable, but many are not, and can be changed or
deleted by the NFT contract owner.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that a particular Ethereum NFT is immutable, the contract
code must be audited, which requires detailed knowledge of the EVM and Solidity
semantics.</p>
<p>It is very hard for a non-technical user to determine whether or not a given
Ethereum NFT is mutable or immutable, and Ethereum NFT platforms make no effort
to distinguish whether an NFT is mutable or immutable, and whether the contract
source code is available and has been audited.</p>
<p><em>Inscription content is always on-chain.</em></p>
<p>There is no way for an inscription to refer to off-chain content. This makes
inscriptions more durable, because content cannot be lost, and scarcer, because
inscription creators must pay fees proportional to the size of the content.</p>
<p>Some Ethereum NFT content is on-chain, but much is off-chain, and is stored on
platforms like IPFS or Arweave, or on traditional, fully centralized web
servers. Content on IPFS is not guaranteed to continue to be available, and
some NFT content stored on IPFS has already been lost. Platforms like Arweave
rely on weak economic assumptions, and will likely fail catastrophically when
these economic assumptions are no longer met. Centralized web servers may
disappear at any time.</p>
<p>It is very hard for a non-technical user to determine where the content of a
given Ethereum NFT is stored.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are much simpler.</em></p>
<p>Ethereum NFTs depend on the Ethereum network and virtual machine, which are
highly complex, constantly changing, and which introduce changes via
backwards-incompatible hard forks.</p>
<p>Inscriptions, on the other hand, depend on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is
relatively simple and conservative, and which introduces changes via
backwards-compatible soft forks.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are more secure.</em></p>
<p>Inscriptions inherit Bitcoin's transaction model, which allow a user to see
exactly which inscriptions are being transferred by a transaction before they
sign it. Inscriptions can be offered for sale using partially signed
transactions, which don't require allowing a third party, such as an exchange
or marketplace, to transfer them on the user's behalf.</p>
<p>By comparison, Ethereum NFTs are plagued with end-user security
vulnerabilities. It is commonplace to blind-sign transactions, grant
third-party apps unlimited permissions over a user's NFTs, and interact with
complex and unpredictable smart contracts. This creates a minefield of hazards
for Ethereum NFT users which are simply not a concern for ordinal theorists.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are scarcer.</em></p>
<p>Inscriptions require bitcoin to mint, transfer, and store. This seems like a
downside on the surface, but the raison d'etre of digital artifacts is to be
scarce and thus valuable.</p>
<p>Ethereum NFTs, on the other hand, can be minted in virtually unlimited
qualities with a single transaction, making them inherently less scarce, and
thus, potentially less valuable.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions do not pretend to support on-chain royalties.</em></p>
<p>On-chain royalties are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Royalty
payment cannot be enforced on-chain without complex and invasive restrictions.
The Ethereum NFT ecosystem is currently grappling with confusion around
royalties, and is collectively coming to grips with the reality that on-chain
royalties, which were messaged to artists as an advantage of NFTs, are not
possible, while platforms race to the bottom and remove royalty support.</p>
<p>Inscriptions avoid this situation entirely by making no false promises of
supporting royalties on-chain, thus avoiding the confusion, chaos, and
negativity of the Ethereum NFT situation.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions unlock new markets.</em></p>
<p>Bitcoin's market capitalization and liquidity are greater than Ethereum's by a
large margin. Much of this liquidity is not available to Ethereum NFTs, since
many Bitcoiners prefer not to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem due to
concerns related to simplicity, security, and decentralization.</p>
<p>Such Bitcoiners may be more interested in inscriptions than Ethereum NFTs,
unlocking new classes of collector.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions have a richer data model.</em></p>
<p>Inscriptions consist of a content type, also known as a MIME type, and content,
which is an arbitrary byte string. This is the same data model used by the web,
and allows inscription content to evolve with the web, and come to support any
kind of content supported by web browsers, without requiring changes to the
underlying protocol.</p>
<h3 id="rgb-and-taro-assets"><a class="header" href="#rgb-and-taro-assets">RGB and Taro assets?</a></h3>
<p>RGB and Taro are both second-layer asset protocols built on Bitcoin. Compared
to inscriptions, they are much more complicated, but much more featureful.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory has been designed from the ground up for digital artifacts,
whereas the primary use-case of RGB and Taro are fungible tokens, so the user
experience for inscriptions is likely to be simpler and more polished than the
user experience for RGB and Taro NFTs.</p>
<p>RGB and Taro both store content off-chain, which requires additional
infrastructure, and which may be lost. By contrast, inscription content is
stored on-chain, and cannot be lost.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory, RGB, and Taro are all very early, so this is speculation, but
ordinal theory's focus may give it the edge in terms of features for digital
artifacts, including a better content model, and features like globally unique
symbols.</p>
<h3 id="counterparty-assets"><a class="header" href="#counterparty-assets">Counterparty assets?</a></h3>
<p>Counterparty has its own token, XCP, which is required for some functionality,
which makes most bitcoiners regard it as an altcoin, and not an extension or
second layer for bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory has been designed from the ground up for digital artifacts,
whereas Counterparty was primarily designed for financial token issuance.</p>
<h2 id="inscriptions-for"><a class="header" href="#inscriptions-for">Inscriptions for…</a></h2>
<h3 id="artists"><a class="header" href="#artists">Artists</a></h3>
<p><em>Inscriptions are on Bitcoin.</em> Bitcoin is the digital currency with the highest
status and greatest chance of long-term survival. If you want to guarantee that
your art survives into the future, there is no better way to publish it than as
inscriptions.</p>
<p><em>Cheaper on-chain storage.</em> At $20,000 per BTC and the minimum relay fee of 1
satoshi per vbyte, publishing inscription content costs $50 per 1 million
bytes.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are early!</em> Inscriptions are still in development, and have not
yet launched on mainnet. This gives you an opportunity to be an early adopter,
and explore the medium as it evolves.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are simple.</em> Inscriptions do not require writing or understanding
smart contracts.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions unlock new liquidity.</em> Inscriptions are more accessible and
appealing to bitcoin holders, unlocking an entirely new class of collector.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are designed for digital artifacts.</em> Inscriptions are designed
from the ground up to support NFTs, and feature a better data model, and
features like globally unique symbols and enhanced provenance.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions do not support on-chain royalties.</em> This is negative, but only
depending on how you look at it. On-chain royalties have been a boon for
creators, but have also created a huge amount of confusion in the Ethereum NFT
ecosystem. The ecosystem now grapples with this issue, and is is engaged in a
race to the bottom, towards a royalties-optional future. Inscriptions have no
support for on-chain royalties, because they are technically infeasible. If you
choose to create inscriptions, there are many ways you can work around this
limitation: withhold a portion of your inscriptions for future sale, to benefit
from future appreciation, or perhaps offer perks for users who respect optional
royalties.</p>
<h3 id="collectors"><a class="header" href="#collectors">Collectors</a></h3>
<p><em>Inscriptions are simple, clear, and have no surprises.</em> They are always
immutable and on-chain, with no special due diligence required.</p>
<p><em>Inscriptions are on Bitcoin.</em> You can verify the location and properties of
inscriptions easily with Bitcoin full node that you control.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoiners"><a class="header" href="#bitcoiners">Bitcoiners</a></h3>
<p>Let me begin this section by saying: the most important thing that the Bitcoin
network does is decentralize money. All other use-cases are secondary,
including ordinal theory. The developers of ordinal theory understand and
acknowledge this, and believe that ordinal theory helps, at least in a small
way, Bitcoin's primary mission.</p>
<p>Unlike many other things in the altcoin space, digital artifacts have merit.
There are, of course, a great deal of NFTs that are ugly, stupid, and
fraudulent. However, there are many that are fantastically creative, and
creating and collecting art has been a part of the human story since its
inception, and predates even trade and money, which are also ancient
technologies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin provides an amazing platform for creating and collecting digital
artifacts in a secure, decentralized way, that protects users and artists in
the same way that it provides an amazing platform for sending and receiving
value, and for all the same reasons.</p>
<p>Ordinals and inscriptions increase demand for Bitcoin block space, which
increase Bitcoin's security budget, which is vital for safeguarding Bitcoin's
transition to a fee-dependent security model, as the block subsidy is halved
into insignificance.</p>
<p>Inscription content is stored on-chain, and thus the demand for block space for
use in inscriptions is unlimited. This creates a buyer of last resort for <em>all</em>
Bitcoin block space. This will help support a robust fee market, which ensures
that Bitcoin remains secure.</p>
<p>Inscriptions also counter the narrative that Bitcoin cannot be extended or used
for new use-cases. If you follow projects like DLCs, Fedimint, Lightning, Taro,
and RGB, you know that this narrative is false, but inscriptions provide a
counter argument which is easy to understand, and which targets a popular and
proven use case, NFTs, which makes it highly legible.</p>
<p>If inscriptions prove, as the authors hope, to be highly sought after digital
artifacts with a rich history, they will serve as a powerful hook for Bitcoin
adoption: come for the fun, rich art, stay for the decentralized digital money.</p>
<p>Inscriptions are an extremely benign source of demand for block space. Unlike,
for example, stablecoins, which potentially give large stablecoin issuers
influence over the future of Bitcoin development, or DeFi, which might
centralize mining by introducing opportunities for MEV, digital art and
collectables on Bitcoin, are unlikely to produce individual entities with
enough power to corrupt Bitcoin. Art is decentralized.</p>
<p>Inscription users and service providers are incentivized to run Bitcoin full
nodes, to publish and track inscriptions, and thus throw their economic weight
behind the honest chain.</p>
<p>Ordinal theory and inscriptions do not meaningfully affect Bitcoin's
fungibility. Bitcoin users can ignore both and be unaffected.</p>
<p>We hope that ordinal theory strengthens and enriches bitcoin, and gives it
another dimension of appeal and functionality, enabling it more effectively
serve its primary use case as humanity's decentralized store of value.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find an issue you want to work on.</li>
<li>Figure out what would be a good first step towards resolving the issue. This
could be in the form of code, research, a proposal, or suggesting that it be
closed, if it's out of date or not a good idea in the first place.</li>
<li>Comment on the issue with an outline of your suggested first step, and
asking for feedback. Of course, you can dive in and start writing code or
tests immediately, but this avoids potentially wasted effort, if the issue
is out of date, not clearly specified, blocked on something else, or
otherwise not ready to implement.</li>
<li>If the issue requires a code change or bugfix, open a draft PR with tests,
and ask for feedback. This makes sure that everyone is on the same page
about what needs to be done, or what the first step in solving the issue
should be. Also, since tests are required, writing the tests first makes it
easy to confirm that the change can be tested easily.</li>
<li>Mash the keyboard randomly until the tests pass, and refactor until the code

<p>Ideas for small issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new test or test case that increases test coverage</li>
<li>Add or improve documentation</li>
<li>Find an issue that needs more research, and do that research and summarize it
in a comment</li>
<li>Find an out-of-date issue and comment that it can be closed</li>
<li>Find an issue that shouldn't be done, and provide constrictive feedback
detailing why you think that is the case</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="merge-early-and-often"><a class="header" href="#merge-early-and-often">Merge early and often</a></h2>
<p>Break up large tasks into multiple smaller steps that individually make
progress. If there's a bug, you can open a PR that adds a failing ignored test.
This can be merged, and the next step can be to fix the bug and unignore the
test. Do research or testing, and report on your results. Break a feature into
small sub-features, and implement them one at a time.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to break down a larger PR into smaller PRs where each can be
merged is a art form well-worth practicing. The hard part is that each PR must
itself be an improvement.</p>
<p>I strive to follow this advice myself, and am always better off when I do.</p>
<p>Small changes are fast to write, review, and merge, which is much more fun than
laboring over a single giant PR that takes forever to write, review, and merge.
Small changes don't take much time, so if you need to stop working on a small
change, you won't have wasted much time as compared to a larger change that
represents many hours of work. Getting a PR in quickly improves the project a
little bit immediately, instead of having to wait a long time for larger
improvement. Small changes are less likely to accumulate merge conflict. As the

<p>Ordinals is an open-source project by me, Casey Rodarmor, in development since
early 2022. I have been assisted by a ragtag band of contributors, bitcoiners,
and degenerates, including two paid apprentices. All project costs have been
paid out of pocket by me, and I have not raised outside funds, and may never.</p>
<p>If you so desire, consider a donation. Donations of bitcoin are appreciated,
but donations of rare, exotic, and inscribed sats are especially treasured.</p>
<p>Donations are not tax-deductible, refundable, or earmarked for any specific
purpose. They are personal gifts to me, made out of love, support,
encouragement, or in the vain hope that if I get enough bitcoin I'll stop doing
all this and go away.</p>
<p>Donations may be sold, lost, given away, or held until death. Donations of
bitcoin are likely to be spent on rare and exotic sats and making whole-block
inscriptions.</p>
<p>Ordinals and inscriptions are a love letter to Bitcoin, the Internet,
programming, and the World Wide Web. Money is nice, but that's not why I'm
doing it. Don't worry if you can't donate. Merely using this strange, evolving
creation is thanks enough. I love having you along for the ride, wherever it
may take us.</p>
<p>I have in my possession <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOlsa6K5TI">21

<p>Pick one that speaks to you, and send to it what you will.</p>
<p>Love,

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ordinal-inscription-guide"><a class="header" href="#ordinal-inscription-guide">Ordinal Inscription Guide</a></h1>
<p>Individual sats can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating
Bitcoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in a Bitcoin wallet and
transferred using Bitcoin transactions. Inscriptions are as durable, immutable,
secure, and decentralized as Bitcoin itself.</p>
<p>Working with inscriptions requires a Bitcoin full node, to give you a view of
the current state of the Bitcoin blockchain, and a wallet that can create
inscriptions and perform sat control when constructing transactions to send
inscriptions to another wallet.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Core provides both a Bitcoin full node and wallet. However, the Bitcoin
Core wallet cannot create inscriptions and does not perform sat control.</p>
<p>This requires an the ordinal-aware utility, like <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb"><code>arb</code></a>. <code>arb</code>
doesn't implement its own wallet, so <code>arb wallet</code> subcommands interact with
Bitcoin Core wallets.</p>
<p>This guide covers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing Bitcoin Core</li>
<li>Syncing the Bitcoin blockchain</li>
<li>Creating a Bitcoin Core wallet</li>
<li>Using <code>arb wallet receive</code> to receive sats</li>
<li>Creating inscriptions with <code>arb wallet inscribe</code></li>
<li>Sending inscriptions with <code>arb wallet send</code></li>
<li>Receiving inscriptions with <code>arb wallet receive</code></li>

<h2 id="installing-bitcoin-core"><a class="header" href="#installing-bitcoin-core">Installing Bitcoin Core</a></h2>
<p>Bitcoin Core is available from <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">bitcoincore.org</a> on
the <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/">download page</a>.</p>
<p>Making inscriptions requires Bitcoin Core 24 or newer.</p>
<p>This guide does not cover installing Bitcoin Core in detail. Once Bitcoin Core
is installed, you should be able to run <code>bitcoind -version</code> successfully from
the command line.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-bitcoin-core"><a class="header" href="#configuring-bitcoin-core">Configuring Bitcoin Core</a></h2>
<p><code>arb</code> requires Bitcoin Core's transaction index.</p>
<p>To configure your Bitcoin Core node to maintain a transaction
index, add the following to your <code>bitcoin.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>txindex=1
</code></pre>
<p>Or, run <code>bitcoind</code> with <code>-txindex</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bitcoind -txindex
</code></pre>
<h2 id="syncing-the-bitcoin-blockchain"><a class="header" href="#syncing-the-bitcoin-blockchain">Syncing the Bitcoin Blockchain</a></h2>
<p>To sync the chain, run:</p>
<pre><code>bitcoind -txindex
</code></pre>
<p>…and leave it running until <code>getblockcount</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bitcoin-cli getblockcount
</code></pre>
<p>agrees with the block count on a block explorer like <a href="https://mempool.space/">the mempool.space block
explorer</a>. <code>arb</code> interacts with <code>bitcoind</code>, so you
should leave <code>bitcoind</code> running in the background when you're using <code>arb</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-arb"><a class="header" href="#installing-arb">Installing <code>arb</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>arb</code> utility is written in Rust and can be built from
<a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb">source</a>. Pre-built binaries are available on the
<a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<p>You can install the latest pre-built binary from the command line with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyjvazum/arb/master/install.sh | bash -s
</code></pre>
<p>Once <code>arb</code> is installed, you should be able to run:</p>
<pre><code>arb --version
</code></pre>
<p>Which prints out <code>arb</code>'s version number.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-bitcoin-core-wallet"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-bitcoin-core-wallet">Creating a Bitcoin Core Wallet</a></h2>
<p><code>arb</code> uses Bitcoin Core to manage private keys, sign transactions, and
broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>To create a Bitcoin Core wallet named <code>arb</code> for use with <code>arb</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet create
</code></pre>
<h2 id="receiving-sats"><a class="header" href="#receiving-sats">Receiving Sats</a></h2>
<p>Inscriptions are made on individual sats, using normal Bitcoin transactions
that pay fees in sats, so your wallet will need some sats.</p>
<p>Get a new address from your <code>arb</code> wallet by running:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet receive
</code></pre>
<p>And send it some funds.</p>
<p>You can see pending transactions with:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet transactions
</code></pre>
<p>Once the transaction confirms, you should be able to see the transactions
outputs with <code>arb wallet outputs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-inscription-content"><a class="header" href="#creating-inscription-content">Creating Inscription Content</a></h2>
<p>Sats can be inscribed with any kind of content, but the <code>arb</code> wallet only
supports content types that can be displayed by the <code>arb</code> block explorer.</p>
<p>Additionally, inscriptions are included in transactions, so the larger the
content, the higher the fee that the inscription transaction must pay.</p>
<p>Inscription content is included in transaction witnesses, which receive the
witness discount. To calculate the approximate fee that an inscribe transaction
will pay, divide the content size by four and muliply by the fee rate.</p>
<p>Inscription transactions must be less than 400,000 weight units, or they will
not be relayed by Bitcoin Core. One byte of inscription content costs one
weight unit. Since an inscription transaction includes not just the inscription
content, limit inscription content to less than 400,000 weight units. 390,000
weight units should be safe.</p>
<h2 id="creating-inscriptions"><a class="header" href="#creating-inscriptions">Creating Inscriptions</a></h2>
<p>To create an inscription with the contents of <code>FILE</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet inscribe --fee-rate FEE_RATE FILE
</code></pre>
<p>Arb will output two transactions IDs, one for the commit transaction, and one
for the reveal transaction, and the inscription ID. Inscription IDs are of the
form <code>TXIDiN</code>, where <code>TXID</code> is the transaction ID of the reveal transaction,
and <code>N</code> is the index of the inscription in the reveal transaction.</p>
<p>The commit transaction commits to a tapscript containing the contents of the
inscription, and the reveal transaction spends from that tapscript, revealing
the contents on chain and inscribing them on the first sat of the first output
of the reveal transaction.</p>
<p>Wait for the reveal transaction to be mined. You can check the status of the
commit and reveal transactions using  <a href="https://mempool.space/">the mempool.space block
explorer</a>.</p>
<p>Once the reveal transaction has been mined, the inscription ID should be
printed when you run:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet inscriptions
</code></pre>
<p>And when you visit a standards-compliant <a href="https://ordinals.com/">ordinals explorer</a> at
<code>/inscription/INSCRIPTION_ID</code>.</p>
<h2 id="sending-inscriptions"><a class="header" href="#sending-inscriptions">Sending Inscriptions</a></h2>
<p>Ask the recipient to generate a new address by running:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet receive
</code></pre>
<p>Send the inscription by running:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet send --fee-rate &lt;FEE_RATE&gt; &lt;ADDRESS&gt; &lt;INSCRIPTION_ID&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>See the pending transaction with:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet transactions
</code></pre>
<p>Once the send transaction confirms, the recipient can confirm receipt by
running:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet inscriptions
</code></pre>
<h2 id="receiving-inscriptions"><a class="header" href="#receiving-inscriptions">Receiving Inscriptions</a></h2>
<p>Generate a new receive address using:</p>

<p>The sender can transfer the inscription to your address using:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet send ADDRESS INSCRIPTION_ID
</code></pre>
<p>See the pending transaction with:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet transactions

<p>Once the send transaction confirms, you can can confirm receipt by running:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet inscriptions

<p><em>This guide is out of date. Since it was written, the <code>arb</code> binary was changed
to only build the full satoshi index when the <code>--index-sats</code> flag is supplied.
Additionally, <code>arb</code> now has a built-in wallet that wraps a Bitcoin Core wallet.
See <code>arb wallet --help</code>.</em></p>
<p>Ordinal hunting is difficult but rewarding. The feeling of owning a wallet full
of UTXOs, redolent with the scent of rare and exotic sats, is beyond compare.</p>
<p>Ordinals are numbers for satoshis. Every satoshi has an ordinal number and
every ordinal number has a satoshi.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a class="header" href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things you'll need before you start.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, you'll need a synced Bitcoin Core node with a transaction index. To
turn on transaction indexing, pass <code>-txindex</code> on the command-line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoind -txindex
</code></pre>
<p>Or put the following in your <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bitcoin-conf.md#configuration-file-path">Bitcoin configuration
file</a>:</p>
<pre><code>txindex=1
</code></pre>
<p>Launch it and wait for it to catch up to the chain tip, at which point the
following command should print out the current block height:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli getblockcount
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, you'll need a synced <code>arb</code> index.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get a copy of <code>arb</code> from <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/">the repo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>RUST_LOG=info arb index</code>. It should connect to your bitcoin core
node and start indexing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for it to finish indexing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, you'll need a wallet with UTXOs that you want to search.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>arb wallet</code> command is just a wrapper around Bitcoin Core's RPC API, so
searching for rare ordinals in a Bitcoin Core wallet is Easy. Assuming your
wallet is named <code>foo</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Load your wallet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli loadwallet foo
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display any rare ordinals wallet <code>foo</code>'s UTXOs:</p>

<p>The <code>arb wallet</code> command is just a wrapper around Bitcoin Core's RPC API, so to
search for rare ordinals in a non-Bitcoin Core wallet, you'll need to import
your wallet's descriptors into Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md">Descriptors</a>
describe the ways that wallets generate private keys and public keys.</p>
<p>You should only import descriptors into Bitcoin Core for your wallet's public
keys, not its private keys.</p>
<p>If your wallet's public key descriptor is compromised, an attacker will be able
to see your wallet's addresses, but your funds will be safe.</p>
<p>If your wallet's private key descriptor is compromised, an attacker can drain
your wallet of funds.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get the wallet descriptor from the wallet whose UTXOs you want to search for
rare ordinals. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>wpkh([bf1dd55e/84'/0'/0']xpub6CcJtWcvFQaMo39ANFi1MyXkEXM8T8ZhnxMtSjQAdPmVSTHYnc8Hwoc11VpuP8cb8JUTboZB5A7YYGDonYySij4XTawL6iNZvmZwdnSEEep/0/*)#csvefu29
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a watch-only wallet named <code>foo-watch-only</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli createwallet foo-watch-only true true
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to give it a better name than <code>foo-watch-only</code>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load the <code>foo-watch-only</code> wallet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli loadwallet foo-watch-only
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import your wallet descriptors into <code>foo-watch-only</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli importdescriptors \
  '[{ &quot;desc&quot;: &quot;wpkh([bf1dd55e/84h/0h/0h]xpub6CcJtWcvFQaMo39ANFi1MyXkEXM8T8ZhnxMtSjQAdPmVSTHYnc8Hwoc11VpuP8cb8JUTboZB5A7YYGDonYySij4XTawL6iNZvmZwdnSEEep/0/*)#tpnxnxax&quot;, &quot;timestamp&quot;:0 }]'
</code></pre>
<p>If you know the Unix timestamp when your wallet first started receive
transactions, you may use it for the value of <code>&quot;timestamp&quot;</code> instead of <code>0</code>.
This will reduce the time it takes for Bitcoin Core to search for your
wallet's UTXOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that everything worked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display your wallet's rare ordinals:</p>

<p>Some descriptors describe multiple paths in one descriptor using angle brackets,
e.g., <code>&lt;0;1&gt;</code>. Multi-path descriptors are not yet supported by Bitcoin Core, so
you'll first need to convert them into multiple descriptors, and then import
those multiple descriptors into Bitcoin Core.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First get the multi-path descriptor from your wallet. It will look something
like this:</p>

<li>
<p>Create a descriptor for the receive address path:</p>

<p>The <code>arb</code> wallet supports transferring specific satoshis. You can also use
<code>bitcoin-cli</code> commands <code>createrawtransaction</code>, <code>signrawtransactionwithwallet</code>,
and <code>sendrawtransaction</code>, how to do so is complex and outside the scope of this
guide.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collecting"><a class="header" href="#collecting">Collecting</a></h1>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/">arb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/">ord</a> are the 
only wallets supporting sat-control and sat-selection, which are required to safely store and send 
rare sats and inscriptions, hereafter ordinals.</p>
<p>The recommended way to send, receive, and store ordinals is with <code>arb</code>, but if
you are careful, it is possible to safely store, and in some cases send,
ordinals with other wallets.</p>
<p>As a general note, receiving ordinals in an unsupported wallet is not
dangerous. Ordinals can be sent to any bitcoin address, and are safe as long as
the UTXO that contains them is not spent. However, if that wallet is then used
to send bitcoin, it may select the UTXO containing the ordinal as an input, and
send the inscription or spend it to fees.</p>
<p>A <a href="guides/./collecting/sparrow-wallet.html">guide</a> to creating an Ordinals-compatible wallet with 
<a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>, is available in this handbook.</p>
<p>Please note that if you follow this guide, you should not use the wallet you
create to send BTC, unless you perform manual coin-selection to avoid sending
ordinals.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collecting-inscriptions-and-ordinals-with-sparrow-wallet"><a class="header" href="#collecting-inscriptions-and-ordinals-with-sparrow-wallet">Collecting Inscriptions and Ordinals with Sparrow Wallet</a></h1>
<p>Users who cannot or have not yet set up the <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb">arb</a> wallet can receive inscriptions and ordinals with alternative bitcoin wallets, as long as they are <em>very</em> careful about how they spend from that wallet.</p>
<p>This guide gives some basic steps on how to create a wallet with <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> which is compatible with <code>arb</code> and can be later imported into <code>arb</code></p>
<h2 id="-warning-"><a class="header" href="#-warning-">⚠️⚠️ Warning!! ⚠️⚠️</a></h2>
<p>As a general rule if you take this approach, you should use this wallet with the Sparrow software as a receive-only wallet.</p>
<p>Do not spend any satoshis from this wallet unless you are sure you know what you are doing. You could very easily inadvertently lose access to your ordinals and inscriptions if you don't heed this warning.</p>
<h2 id="wallet-setup--receiving"><a class="header" href="#wallet-setup--receiving">Wallet Setup &amp; Receiving</a></h2>
<p>Download the Sparrow Wallet from the <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/">releases page</a> for your particular operating system.</p>
<p>Select <code>File -&gt; New Wallet</code> and create a new wallet called <code>arb</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Change the <code>Script Type</code> to <code>Taproot (P2TR)</code> and select the <code>New or Imported Software Wallet</code> option.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_02.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Select <code>Use 12 Words</code> and then click <code>Generate New</code>. Leave the passphrase blank.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_03.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A new 12 word BIP39 seed phrase will be generated for you. Write this down somewhere safe as this is your backup to get access to your wallet. NEVER share or show this seed phrase to anyone else.</p>
<p>Once you have written down the seed phrase click <code>Confirm Backup</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_04.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Re-enter the seed phrase which you wrote down, and then click <code>Create Keystore</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_05.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click <code>Import Keystore</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_06.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click <code>Apply</code>. Add a password for the wallet if you want to.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_07.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You now have a wallet which is compatible with <code>arb</code>, and can be imported into <code>arb</code> using the BIP39 Seed Phrase. To receive ordinals or inscriptions, click on the <code>Receive</code> tab and copy a new address.</p>
<p>Each time you want to receive you should use a brand-new address, and not re-use existing addresses.</p>
<p>Note that bitcoin is different to some other blockchain wallets, in that this wallet can generate an unlimited number of new addreses. You can generate a new address by clicking on the <code>Get Next Address</code> button. You can see all of your addresses in the <code>Addresses</code> tab of the app.</p>
<p>You can add a label to each address, so you can keep track of what it was used for.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/wallet_setup_08.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="validating--viewing-received-inscriptions"><a class="header" href="#validating--viewing-received-inscriptions">Validating / Viewing Received Inscriptions</a></h2>
<p>Once you have received an inscription you will see a new transaction in the <code>Transactions</code> tab of Sparrow, as well as a new UTXO in the <code>UTXOs</code> tab.</p>
<p>Initially this transaction may have an &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; status, and you will need to wait for it to be mined into a bitcoin block before it is fully received.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/validating_viewing_01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To track the status of your transaction you can right-click on it,  select <code>Copy Transaction ID</code> and then paste that transaction id into <a href="https://mempool.space">mempool.space</a>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/validating_viewing_02.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once the transaction has confirmed, you can validate and view your inscription by heading over to the <code>UTXOs</code> tab, finding the UTXO you want to check, right-clicking on the <code>Output</code> and selecting <code>Copy Transaction Output</code>. This transaction output id can then be pasted into the <a href="https://ordinals.com">ordinals.com</a> search.</p>
<h2 id="freezing-utxos"><a class="header" href="#freezing-utxos">Freezing UTXO's</a></h2>
<p>As explained above, each of your inscriptions is stored in an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). You want to be very careful not to accidentally spend your inscriptions, and one way to make it harder for this to happen is to freeze the UTXO.</p>
<p>To do this, go to the <code>UTXOs</code> tab, find the UTXO you want to freeze, right-click on the <code>Output</code> and select <code>Freeze UTXO</code>.</p>
<p>This UTXO (Inscription) is now un-spendable within the Sparrow Wallet until you unfreeze it.</p>
<h2 id="importing-into-arb-wallet"><a class="header" href="#importing-into-arb-wallet">Importing into <code>arb</code> wallet</a></h2>
<p>For details on setting up Bitcoin Core and the <code>arb</code> wallet check out the <a href="guides/collecting/../inscriptions.html">Inscriptions Guide</a></p>
<p>When setting up <code>arb</code>, instead of running <code>arb wallet create</code> to create a brand-new wallet, you can import your existing wallet using <code>arb wallet restore &quot;BIP39 SEED PHRASE&quot;</code> using the seed phrase you generated with Sparrow Wallet.</p>
<p>There is currently a <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb/issues/1589">bug</a> which causes an imported wallet to not be automatically rescanned against the blockchain. To work around this you will need to manually trigger a rescan using the bitcoin core cli:
<code>bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=arb rescanblockchain 767430</code></p>
<p>You can then check your wallet's inscriptions using <code>arb wallet inscriptions</code></p>
<p>Note that if you have previously created a wallet with <code>arb</code>, then you will already have a wallet with the default name, and will need to give your imported wallet a different name. You can use the <code>--wallet</code> parameter in all <code>arb</code> commands to reference a different wallet, eg:</p>
<p><code>arb --wallet arb_from_sparrow restore &quot;BIP39 SEED PHRASE&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>arb --wallet arb_from_sparrow wallet inscriptions</code></p>
<p><code>bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=arb_from_sparrow rescanblockchain 767430</code></p>

<h4 id="-warning--1"><a class="header" href="#-warning--1">⚠️⚠️ Warning ⚠️⚠️</a></h4>
<p>While it is highly recommended that you set up a bitcoin core node and run the <code>arb</code> software, there are certain limited ways you can send inscriptions out of Sparrow Wallet in a safe way. Please note that this is not recommended, and you should only do this if you fully understand what you are doing.</p>
<p>Using the <code>arb</code> software will remove much of the complexity we are describing here, as it is able to automatically and safely handle sending inscriptions in an easy way.</p>
<h4 id="-additional-warning-"><a class="header" href="#-additional-warning-">⚠️⚠️ Additional Warning ⚠️⚠️</a></h4>
<p>Don't use your sparrow inscriptions wallet to do general sends of non-inscription bitcoin. You can setup a separate wallet in sparrow if you need to do normal bitcoin transactions, and keep your inscriptions wallet separate.</p>
<h4 id="bitcoins-utxo-model"><a class="header" href="#bitcoins-utxo-model">Bitcoin's UTXO model</a></h4>
<p>Before sending any transaction it's important that you have a good mental model for bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) system. The way Bitcoin works is fundamentally different to many other blockchains such as Ethereum. In Ethereum generally you have a single address in which you store ETH, and you cannot differentiate between any of the ETH -  it is just all a single value of the total amount in that address. Bitcoin works very differently in that we generate a new address in the wallet for each receive, and every time you receive sats to an address in your wallet you are creating a new UTXO. Each UTXO can be seen and managed individually. You can select specific UTXO's which you want to spend, and you can choose not to spend certain UTXO's.</p>
<p>Some Bitcoin wallets do not expose this level of detail, and they just show you a single summed up value of all the bitcoin in your wallet. However, when sending inscriptions it is important that you use a wallet like Sparrow which allows for UTXO control.</p>
<h4 id="inspecting-your-inscription-before-sending"><a class="header" href="#inspecting-your-inscription-before-sending">Inspecting your inscription before sending</a></h4>
<p>Like we have previously described inscriptions are inscribed onto sats, and sats are stored within UTXOs. UTXO's are a collection of satoshis with some particular value of the number of satoshis (the output value). Usually (but not always) the inscription will be inscribed on the first satoshi in the UTXO.</p>
<p>When inspecting your inscription before sending the main thing you will want to check is which satoshi in the UTXO your inscription is inscribed on.</p>
<p>To do this, you can follow the <a href="guides/collecting/./sparrow-wallet.html#validating--viewing-received-inscriptions">Validating / Viewing Received Inscriptions</a> described above to find the inscription page for your inscription on ordinals.com</p>
<p>There you will find some metadata about your inscription which looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is a few of important things to check here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>output</code> identifier matches the identifier of the UTXO you are going to send</li>
<li>The <code>offset</code> of the inscription is <code>0</code> (this means that the inscription is located on the first sat in the UTXO)</li>
<li>the <code>output_value</code> has enough sats to cover the transaction fee (postage) for sending the transaction. The exact amount you will need depends on the fee rate you will select for the transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of the above are true for your inscription, it should be safe for you to send it using the method below.</p>
<p>⚠️⚠️ Be very careful sending your inscription particularly if the <code>offset</code> value is not <code>0</code>. It is not recommended to use this method if that is the case, as doing so you could accidentally send your inscription to a bitcoin miner unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<h4 id="sending-your-inscription"><a class="header" href="#sending-your-inscription">Sending your inscription</a></h4>
<p>To send an inscription navigate to the <code>UTXOs</code> tab, and find the UTXO which you previously validated contains your inscription.</p>
<p>If you previously froze the UXTO you will need to right-click on it and unfreeze it.</p>
<p>Select the UTXO you want to send, and ensure that is the <em>only</em> UTXO is selected. You should see <code>UTXOs 1/1</code> in the interface. Once you are sure this is the case you can hit <code>Send Selected</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_02.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You will then be presented with the transaction construction interface. There is a few things you need to check here to make sure that this is a safe send:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction should have only 1 input, and this should be the UTXO with the label you want to send</li>
<li>The transaction should have only 1 output, which is the address/label where you want to send the inscription</li>
</ul>
<p>If your transaction looks any different, for example you have multiple inputs, or multiple outputs then this may not be a safe transfer of your inscription, and you should abandon sending until you understand more, or can import into the <code>arb</code> wallet.</p>
<p>You should set an appropriate transaction fee, Sparrow will usually recommend a reasonable one, but you can also check <a href="https://mempool.space">mempool.space</a> to see what the recommended fee rate is for sending a transaction.</p>
<p>You should add a label for the recipient address, a label like <code>alice address for inscription #123</code> would be ideal.</p>
<p>Once you have checked the transaction is a safe transaction using the checks above, and you are confident to send it you can click <code>Create Transaction</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_03.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here again you can double check that your transaction looks safe, and once you are confident you can click <code>Finalize Transaction for Signing</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_04.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here you can triple check everything before hitting <code>Sign</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_05.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And then actually you get very very last chance to check everything before hitting <code>Broadcast Transaction</code>. Once you broadcast the transaction it is sent to the bitcoin network, and starts being propagated into the mempool.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/sending_06.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you want to track the status of your transaction you can copy the <code>Transaction Id (Txid)</code> and paste that into <a href="https://mempool.space">mempool.space</a></p>
<p>Once the transaction has confirmed you can check the inscription page on <a href="https://ordinals.com">ordinals.com</a> to validate that it has moved to the new output location and address.</p>

<p>Make sure that your wallet is connected to a bitcoin node. To validate this, head into the <code>Preferences</code>-&gt; <code>Server</code> settings, and click <code>Edit Existing Connection</code>.</p>
<p><img src="guides/collecting/images/troubleshooting_01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>From there you can select a node and click <code>Test Connection</code> to validate that Sparrow is able to connect successfully.</p>

<p><code>arb</code> includes a block explorer, which you can run locally with <code>arb server</code>.</p>
<p>The block explorer allows viewing inscriptions. Inscriptions are user-generated
content, which may be objectionable or unlawful.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each individual who runs an ordinal block explorer
instance to understand their responsibilities with respect to unlawful content,
and decide what moderation policy is appropriate for their instance.</p>
<p>In order to prevent particular inscriptions from being displayed on an <code>arb</code>
instance, they can be included in a YAML config file, which is loaded with the
<code>--config</code> option.</p>
<p>To hide inscriptions, first create a config file, with the inscription ID you
want to hide:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">hidden:
- 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000i0
</code></pre>
<p>The suggested name for <code>arb</code> config files is <code>arb.yaml</code>, but any filename can
be used.</p>
<p>Then pass the file to <code>--config</code> when starting the server:</p>
<p><code>arb --config arb.yaml server</code></p>
<p>Note that the <code>--config</code> option comes after <code>arb</code> but before the <code>server</code>
subcommand.</p>
<p><code>arb</code> must be restarted in to load changes to the config file.</p>

ordinal theory is extremely simple. A clever hacker should be able to write

<p>Satoshi was the original developer of ordinal theory. However, he knew that
others would consider it heretical and dangerous, so he hid his knowledge,
and it was lost to the sands of time. This potent theory is only now being

2,099,999,997,689,999, the last sat to be mined, is <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>The bounty is open for submissions until block 840000—the first block after the
fourth halvening. Submissions included in block 840000 or later will not be
considered.</p>
<p>Both parts use <a href="bounty/frequency.tsv">frequency.tsv</a>, a list of words and the number
of times they occur in the <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html">Google Books Ngram
dataset</a>.
filtered to only include the names of sats which will have been mined by the
end of the submission period, that appear at least 5000 times in the corpus.</p>
<p><code>frequency.tsv</code> is a file of tab-separated values. The first column is the
word, and the second is the number of times it appears in the corpus. The
entries are sorted from least-frequently occurring to most-frequently
occurring.</p>
<p><code>frequency.tsv</code> was compiled using <a href="https://github.com/casey/onegrams">this
program</a>.</p>
<p>To search an <code>arb</code> wallet for sats with a name in <code>frequency.tsv</code>, use the
following <a href="https://github.com/tyjvazum/arb"><code>arb</code></a> command:</p>
<pre><code>arb wallet sats --tsv frequency.tsv
</code></pre>
<p>This command requires the sat index, so <code>--index-sats</code> must be passed to arb
when first creating the index.</p>

<p><em>Rare sats pair best with rare words.</em></p>
<p>The transaction that submits the UTXO containing the sat whose name appears
with the lowest number of occurrences in <code>frequency.tsv</code> shall be the winner of
part 0.</p>
<h3 id="part-1"><a class="header" href="#part-1">Part 1</a></h3>
<p><em>Popularity is the font of value.</em></p>
<p>The transaction that submits the UTXO containing the sat whose name appears
with the highest number of occurrences in <code>frequency.tsv</code> shall be the winner
of part 1.</p>

<p>In the case of a tie, where two submissions occur with the same frequency, the
earlier submission shall be the winner.</p>
